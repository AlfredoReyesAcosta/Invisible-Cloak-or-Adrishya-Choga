# Harry Potter's Invisibility-Cloak(Adrishya-Choga)

Itâ€™s the cloak which Harry Potter uses to become invisible. Since childhood, I am potter head and all his magics, but it's not real. All are graphics and visualization. In childhood, I always think about what if I have same invsibility cloak. But as I grow I realised in reality, it's nothing like that, but in virtual world it's possible using simple concepts of image processing and opencv. The project of current project is to understand the concept of invisible-cloak.
